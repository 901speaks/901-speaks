## About The Hosts

### Andrew Usher

Andrew Usher is a downtown Memphis bar regular that works in the IT department at AutoZone. After living in Los Angeles for a time and becoming homesick, he made his way back to Memphis.

Andrew was a very closed off person at a younger age, but has slowly become a social butterfly over the years, and has created this podcast to share the stories of his bar hopping buddies.
